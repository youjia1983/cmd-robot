# Microsoft Windows #

For the project the main OS group used is Windows. As of now, all clients run Windows. Tom is running Windows 8, Cian is running Windows 7. We use the following programs on Windows to help with this project be it researching, developing or testing:

  * Command Prompt (every 2 seconds, IP address checking mainly as well as executing python scripts through the interpreter)
  * IDLE (used for coding and testing in Python)
  * Google Chrome/Internet Explorer (researching, updating project page etc)
  * Putty (SSHing into the RPi)
  * WinSCP (File tranfers to and from the RPi)
  * Arduino 1.0.1 SDK (Developing, testing and loading software for the Arduino)
  * Skype (Online communication between members, video, audio, text and screen sharing)
  * RealVNC Viewer (for remote viewing RPi)

# Debian Wheezy, Raspbian #

Rasbian is the Operating System used on our Raspberry Pis. We use the hard float version with a modified config.txt for maximum performance. Rasbian is an ARM OS and optimised for the Raspberry Pi to run special software including:

  * TightVNC Server
  * Python 2.7 with IDLE
