# Introduction #

This page will consolidate all the work that we have completed over the past year into a comprehensive guide for students with minimal software knowledge to complete a similar project based on components interacting with the real world.


## So, What is involved? ##

This tutorial will allow you to learn two programing languages, how to use the linux operating system, basic electronics and concepts such as how programing interacts with the real world.

#### The NSW Syllabus for IST ####

Students will develop:
> 5.1 knowledge and understanding of a range of computer software and hardware.<br />
> 5.2 problem-solving and critical thinking skills in order to design and develop creative information and software technology solutions for a variety of real-world problems.<br />
> 5.5 effective communication skills and collaborative work practices leading to information and software technology solutions for specific problems.


## What you need? ##

You may need to vary the produces below due to supply of some products in different areas or to increase the capabilities of your robot.  Below is the minimum for your robot to work.

### Electronics ###

  * L293D - Dual H-Bridge Motor Drive.
  * Arduino Uno _(or Any other Arduino / Arduino Substitute)_
  * Two 6 volt DC motors _(4 will still work)_
  * Two wheels with mounts to the motor _(or on for each motor)_
  * Raspberry Pi
  * 4GB SD Card (Class 4 or better)
  * USB Wireless Card
  * Raspberry Pi Camera Module **(optional)**
  * USB Power Bank
  * Batteries _(4 AA is referable with spares)_
Alternatively, you could buy a kit <a href='http://www.jaycar.com.au/productView.asp?ID=KR3130'>like this one</a> from Jaycar.  That way you don't have to go to the trouble of finding mounts for the motors, wheels and motors.

### Software ###

  * Python IDE : <a href='http://www.python.org/getit/'>Download List</a>
  * Arduino IDE : <a href='http://arduino.cc/en/main/software'>Download List </a>
  * Raspbian - Raspberry Pi OS :  <a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads'>Download List</a>

### Other ###

  * Computer with internet connection and wireless capabilities
  * SD Card reader
  * Wireless Network
  * Joystick


## Final notes before we begin: ##

The following guide will reference other external sources as well as other wiki pages on this site.  The instructions are not step by step because this project should challenge you to research anything that you may need to know and extend your learning.  It does, however, provide links to resources when necessary for the project to work.

# Lets Start with Programing! #

For this project you will need to learn the "Python 2.7" programing language and some basic concepts of programing.  Another Wiki Page has been made to facilitate this part, found <a href='https://code.google.com/p/cmd-robot/wiki/Python_GettingStarted'> here.</a>


If you have read the above page, please continue.


The <a href='https://code.google.com/p/cmd-robot/wiki/SoftwareDevCycle'> Software Development Cycle </a> should be used through the duration of this project.

### Define the problem ###
The problem statement for this project is: "to develop a piece of software that will be able to wirelessly communicate with your robot and be able to control the robot with a joystick."

#### How do you solve this problem? ####
  * Python scripts (coded by you)
  * Arduino C scripts (coded by Cian Byrne - they are beyond the reach of this tutorial)
  * research and investigation using the Wiki Pages on this site and the Issues Pages for problems you may be having that we have overcome.

#### Outcomes ####
  * Working Scripts
  * Moving Robot


# What about the Hardware? #
We have done this for you already so that you don't have to worry if you don;t know anything about electronics...look at the bottom of this page: https://code.google.com/p/cmd-robot/wiki/H_Bridges


# Solutions #
Sometimes things are just all too hard and you may need to check if what you are doing is on the right track.  All the code we used for this project can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/cmd-robot/wiki/SourceCode
