# Introduction #

CMDoverwatch [R1](https://code.google.com/p/cmd-robot/source/detail?r=1) was crippled by a multitude of impacts and collisions caused by (someone who shall remain disclosed).  [R2](https://code.google.com/p/cmd-robot/source/detail?r=2) is the new and improved version of [R1](https://code.google.com/p/cmd-robot/source/detail?r=1), which should take more impacts and be less affected. Development of this project is ACTIVE!

The new version of CMDoverwatch includes the following upgrades:
