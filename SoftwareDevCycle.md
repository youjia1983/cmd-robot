# Introduction #
The Software Development Cycle is one method that can be used to produce software to solve a problem.  It is a structured method that uses a number of steps to develop the software.

## Defining the problem ##
This step involves the developer defining the problem that has to be solved and then understand the needs of the client and users who will be using the software.  Modelling can be used at this stage.

## Planning ##
This is where a solution is designed and tools used to document the project.

## Implementation (Building) ##
This is where the algorithm is coded into a computer language. This can only be done once the planning has been completed, otherwise, the project is likely to fail.

## Testing & Evaluation ##
This is where the testing of the software takes place.  this normally takes place through the duration of the project.

## Maintaining ##
The operation and maintenance of the program being used.
