# Introduction #

Planning for a new branch of CMDrobotics, UAVs, has begun. The code name for this project is CMDhawkeye.

The hawkeye fleet will feed off CMD base stations and relay real time and lapsed data back to CMDhq and CMDcontrol software clients. Communication methods are yet to be established but the fleet will either be using TCP over WiFi or TCP/IP over 3G/4G.

# Projects #

Work on the first subproject, CMDbutterfly, has begun.
