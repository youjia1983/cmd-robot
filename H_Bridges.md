# Introduction #

H-bridges allow for large current consuming devices, like motors, to be switched on an off (or have their speed varied). In our project we have 2 main H-bridge setups. The first setup is with the Polulu VNH5019 and the second is the L293D IC.


# Polulu VNH5019 #

The Pololu Dual VNH5019 Motor Driver Shield is built specifically for use with an Arduino. It is currently the H-bridge used for CMDoverwatch to operate the 4 motors.

## Features ##
The shield features:
  * Operating voltage range: 5.5 â€“ 24 V1
  * High output current: up to 12 A continuous (30 maximum) per motor
  * Inputs compatible with both 5V and 3.3V systems
  * PWM operation up to 20 kHz, which is ultrasonic and allows for quieter motor operation
  * Motor indicator LEDs show what the outputs are doing even when no motor is connected
  * When used as a shield, the motor power supply can optionally be used to power the Arduino base as well
  * Can survive input voltages up to 41 V

# L293D IC #

The L293D IC is a quadruple half-H driver used in prototype 1,2 and CMDrecon. Future uses may include operating a PWM enabled robotic arm.

## Features ##

  * Wide Supply-Voltage Range: 4.5 V to 36 V
  * Separate Input-Logic Supply
  * Internal ESD Protection
  * Thermal Shutdown
  * High-Noise-Immunity Inputs
  * Output Current 600 mA Per Channel
  * Peak Output Current 1.2 A Per Channel
  * 16 Pin IC socket compatible
  * Inexpensive
  * Small and light

## Schematics ##

Below is an image of how the L293D was used in CMDoverwatch prototypes but also in the current CMDrecon builds. It allows for bidirectional control of 2 motors (or 4 if linked in parallel).
